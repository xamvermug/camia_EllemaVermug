## Tracking the Time Management of Students: The Time Organizer
# by Therenz R. Ellema and Xanthus G. Vermug
In school, students often struggle with managing their time effectively, especially when they have multiple assignments, projects, and activities to complete. Many tend to forget deadlines or mismanage their schedules, which can lead to stress and unfinished work. This is why I came up with the idea of creating a Simple Student Time Management Program.
This program aims to help students organize their tasks by allowing them to list everything they need to do, mark what they have completed, and see how much time they still need to spend on pending work. Instead of manually writing tasks on paper or trying to remember everything, this program helps students manage their workload in a simpler and more organized way.

# Objectives:
My program aims to achieve the following goals:
1.	Help students keep track of their school tasks and deadlines.
2.	Allow students to mark tasks as completed once they finish them.
3.	Show the total number of hours needed to complete unfinished tasks.
4.	Make time management easier through a clear and simple system.
5.	Encourage students to plan ahead and prioritize important work.

# Planned Features:
• Let students input their task name, due date, estimated hours, and priority level (High, Medium, or Low).
• Display all the current tasks, showing which ones are done or still pending.
• Allow students to update the status of a task once it is finished.
• Automatically calculate the total estimated time left for all unfinished tasks.
• Include a simple menu where students can easily add, view, or mark their tasks as complete.
• Provide an option to exit the program once they are done managing their tasks.

# Planned Inputs and Outputs:
The program will first ask students to enter the details of their tasks, such as the name, due date, number of hours needed, and priority. After that, the program will store these tasks and show them in an organized list.
For every task, it will display whether it is Pending or Done. Students can also choose to mark a task as completed once they finish it. Additionally, the program will show the total remaining hours of all pending tasks, helping students estimate how much time they still need to manage their schoolwork.
Through these simple inputs and outputs, the program will make it easier for students to track their responsibilities, manage their schedules, and stay productive every day.
